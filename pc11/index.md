Welcome to Mr. Mattson's notes for **BC Pre-calculus 11**.

This course delves deeper into algebraic and trigonometric concepts required for calculus.

## Units:

*   **[Real Numbers](./real-numbers/)**: Classifying numbers within the real number system.
*   **[Powers (Rational Exponents)](./powers-rational-exponents/)**: Working with fractional exponents and exponent laws.
*   **[Radicals](./radicals/)**: Simplifying, ordering, operating with, and solving radical equations.
*   **[Polynomial Factoring](./polynomial-factoring/)**: Advanced factoring techniques (trinomials ax^2+bx+c, difference of squares a^2x^2-b^2y^2).
*   **[Rational Expressions & Equations](./rational-expressions-equations/)**: Simplifying, operating with, and solving rational equations (identifying non-permissible values).
*   **[Quadratic Functions & Equations](./quadratic-functions-equations/)**: Graphing quadratics, transformations, solving quadratic equations (various methods).
*   **[Linear & Quadratic Inequalities](./linear-quadratic-inequalities/)**: Solving inequalities in one variable, sign analysis.
*   **[Trigonometry (Non-Right)](./trigonometry-non-right/)**: Sine Law, Cosine Law (including ambiguous case), angles in standard position (degrees, unit circle).
*   **[Financial Literacy](./financial-literacy/)**: Compound interest, basic investments/loans.

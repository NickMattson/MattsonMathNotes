Welcome to Mr. Mattson's notes for **BC Pre-calculus 12**.

This course prepares students for post-secondary calculus by exploring advanced functions and trigonometry.

## Units:

*   **[Transformations of Functions](./transformations-functions/)**: Applying transformations to various parent functions and relations, including inverses.
*   **[Exponential Functions & Equations](./exponential-functions-equations/)**: Graphing, solving exponential equations (including base e).
*   **[Geometric Sequences & Series](./geometric-sequences-series/)**: Analyzing geometric patterns, infinite series, sigma notation.
*   **[Logarithms](./logarithms/)**: Laws of logarithms, graphing, solving logarithmic equations.
*   **[Polynomial Functions & Equations](./polynomial-functions-equations/)**: Factoring (Factor/Remainder Theorems), graphing characteristics, solving polynomial equations.
*   **[Rational Functions](./rational-functions/)**: Graphing characteristics (asymptotes, intercepts, discontinuities).
*   **[Trigonometry (Functions/Eq./Id.)](./trigonometry-functions-equations-identities/)**: Radians, unit circle, graphing trig functions, solving trig equations, using identities.

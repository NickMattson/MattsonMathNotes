Welcome to Mr. Mattson's notes for **BC Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10**.

This course covers essential topics bridging foundational math to pre-calculus concepts.

## Units:

*   **[Powers & Exponents](./powers-exponents/)**: Operations with integer exponents and exponent laws.
*   **[Prime Factorization](./prime-factorization/)**: Finding prime factors, GCF, and LCM.
*   **[Functions & Relations](./functions-relations/)**: Understanding relations, domain, range, and function notation.
*   **[Linear Functions](./linear-functions/)**: Slope, intercepts, and various forms of linear equations.
*   **[Arithmetic Sequences](./arithmetic-sequences/)**: Identifying and analyzing arithmetic patterns.
*   **[Systems of Linear Equations](./systems-linear-equations/)**: Solving systems graphically and algebraically (substitution, elimination).
*   **[Polynomial Multiplication](./polynomial-multiplication/)**: Multiplying binomials and trinomials.
*   **[Polynomial Factoring](./polynomial-factoring/)**: Common factors, simple trinomials, difference of squares.
*   **[Trigonometry](./trigonometry/)**: Primary trigonometric ratios (SOH CAH TOA) in right triangles.
*   **[Financial Literacy](./financial-literacy/)**: Gross pay, net pay, and deductions.
